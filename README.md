# Introduction
 
This repository builds on top of [mmselfsup](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmselfsup.git). The mmselfsup toolbox is particularly useful for quick self-supervised setup towards training deep learning models, as it includes implementations of many known architectures as well as the required pipeline to integrate data, models, and evaluation. The original repository is designed for general computer vision tasks and is not tailored for remote sensing or other specific types of data.

This repository extends mmselfsup to support remote sensing data. Specifically, for Arctic research, the repository includes many functions from the [RS-VIP/sea-ice-mmseg](https://github.com/RS-VIP/sea-ice-mmseg.git) repository.
